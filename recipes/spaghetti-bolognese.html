        Recipe passed on from my Italian grandfather. 
        The ultimate comfort food.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. 
        Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through 
        yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. 
        Cook the bacon in the oil until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. 
        Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and oregano into the bacon; 
        continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. 
        Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
        Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable mixture; 
        cook and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; 
        allow to simmer until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. 
        Stir the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar into the ground beef mixture; 
        bring the mixture to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat. 
        Stir the fresh basil into the mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. 
        Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.
