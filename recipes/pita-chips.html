        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. 
            Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through 
            yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. 
            Cook the bacon in the oil until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and oregano into the bacon; 
            continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
            Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable mixture; 
            cook and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; 
            allow to simmer until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. 
            Stir the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar into the ground beef mixture; 
            bring the mixture to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat. 
            Stir the fresh basil into the mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. 
            Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
